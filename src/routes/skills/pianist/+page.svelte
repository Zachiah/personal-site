	<h1>I am a pianist</h1>

	<p>I have been playing piano since Septermber 2015</p>
	<p>I started mostly playing church music (hymns and such)</p>
	<p>
		These days I really enjoy improvising based on the emotions I feel in the moment. Playing
		directly with pure creativity is where I feel most comfortable.
	</p>
	<p>
		I play based my ear and a lot of music theory. Lately I've been experimenting a lot with the the
		Aeolian Dominant scale.
