	<h1>I am a pianist</h1>

	<p>I have been playing piano since Septermber 2015</p>
	<p>I mostly play church music (hymns and such) although I have done a tiny bit of classical as well. I play based on music theory and a little bit of reading if available. Lately I've been experimenting a lot with the pentatonic scale and lots of tangential concepts.</p>
