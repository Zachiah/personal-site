	<h1>I am a trampoliner</h1>

	<p>
		I am pretty good at single backflips, frontflips and front-halfs that's about it. I can do
		front-fulls, back-fulls, back-halfs, sideflips, and such but they aren't perfect. What I excel
		at is long strings of flips in a row (long as in scores). Here's my current record for
		consecutive backflips (79).
